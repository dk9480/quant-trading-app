💰 Quant Developer Evaluation Assignment: Real-Time Pair Trading Analytics1. Project ObjectiveThe goal of this project is to implement a complete, end-to-end analytical stack capable of ingesting real-time tick data from the Binance WebSocket, persisting it, running core quantitative analytics (specifically for Pairs Trading), and visualizing the results through an interactive web dashboard.This application is built with extensibility and modularity as primary design principles, serving as a prototype for a larger, real-time analytics system.2. System Architecture & ComponentsThe application follows a modular, decoupled architecture, split into three main services orchestrated by the master script app.py.ComponentTechnologyRoleData Streamer (binance_stream.py)Python, websocketsConnects to the Binance WebSocket, ingests raw tick data, and performs high-frequency writes to the SQLite database.Analytics API (api.py)Python, FastAPI, pandas, statsmodelsProvides high-performance endpoints for fetching data, resampling, and calculating pairs trading metrics (OLS, Spread, Z-score, ADF Test).Frontend Dashboard (quant-frontend/)ReactAn interactive web application for user input, displaying price charts, the spread time series, Z-score, and the final analytical table.3. Architecture Diagram (Mandatory Deliverable)The architecture is visualized below, showing the three services, the central storage, and the control flow managed by the Orchestrator.Shutterstock(Note to Reviewer: The full-resolution image (Architecture_Diagram.png) and the editable source file (Architecture_Diagram.drawio) are included in the root directory, as required.)4. Setup and InstallationThis project requires Python 3.9+ and Node.js/npm.4.1. PrerequisitesClone the Repository: (Assumed complete)Navigate to the Root Directory:cd D:\Project\quant-trading-app
4.2. Python Backend DependenciesActivate Virtual Environment:# Assuming you are using venv (Adjust path for your OS if necessary)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install Python Packages: The following command installs necessary packages like FastAPI, Uvicorn, pandas, and any quant libraries from the dependency file.pip install -r requirements.txt
# (Alternate packages provided by assignment: pip install fastapi uvicorn websockets pandas numpy statsmodels)
4.3. Node/React Frontend DependenciesNavigate to Frontend Directory:cd quant-frontend
Install Node Modules:npm install
Return to Root Directory:cd ..
5. Execution (Single Command)The application is bundled for single-command local execution using the master orchestrator script app.py. This script launches the Data Streamer, FastAPI backend, and React frontend simultaneously.Ensure Virtual Environment is Active.Execute the Application:python app.py
[SCREENSHOT 1: Terminal Output]Please insert a screenshot here showing the console output after running python app.py, clearly demonstrating that the Streamer, FastAPI, and React services have all started successfully and data is being received.Access the Dashboard: Open your web browser and navigate to the React frontend (usually http://localhost:3000). The FastAPI documentation is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.Shutdown: Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running app.py for a clean, simultaneous shutdown of all three services.6. Methodology & Technical Decisions6.1. Data Handling & Persistence (SQLite)Choice: SQLite was chosen for its zero-configuration, file-based nature, ideal for a local prototype.Structure: Tick data is stored in a simple table (ticks) with columns for symbol, timestamp, price, and qty.Scaling Consideration: While sufficient for this prototype, for a high-frequency production system, this would be a major bottleneck. A robust production stack would replace this with a purpose-built time-series database (e.g., TimescaleDB, InfluxDB, or kdb+).6.2. Analytics and Decoupling (FastAPI)Analytics on Demand: The API handles all complex analytics on demand. This ensures the ingestion pipeline remains simple and fast (Write-Only).Code Reusability: Core quantitative logic (e.g., OLS calculation, Z-score) is encapsulated in a dedicated Python module, separate from the API routing (api.py), promoting clean design and testability.6.3. Frontend (React)Visualization: React was chosen for its component-based architecture, allowing for clean separation of concerns.User Experience: Provides interactive controls for selecting symbols, timeframe, lookback window, and regression type.7. Quantitative Analytics ImplementationThe core logic resides in the FastAPI endpoints:7.1. Price ResamplingRaw tick data is resampled to a regular time interval (e.g., 1-minute bars).Process: The API queries tick data and resamples to the specified timeframe (e.g., 1T).Aggregation: The last observed price (.last()) is used for the price series.7.2. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) RegressionUsed to estimate the hedge ratio ($\beta$).Model: $\log(\text{S2}) = \alpha + \beta \cdot \log(\text{S1}) + \epsilon$Hedge Ratio ($\beta$): The slope coefficient ($\beta$) is calculated using the statsmodels.api library to perform a rolling OLS regression over the specified window.7.3. Spread/Residuals CalculationThe spread represents the deviation from the estimated long-term equilibrium.Calculation: $\text{Spread} = \log(\text{S2}) - (\beta \cdot \log(\text{S1}) + \alpha)$(Note: If OLS is run without the intercept, the formula simplifies to: $\text{Spread} = \log(\text{S2}) - \beta \cdot \log(\text{S1})$)7.4. Z-Score NormalizationNormalizes the spread to indicate standard deviation from the mean, serving as the signal.Calculation:$$\text{Z-Score} = \frac{\text{Spread} - \text{Rolling Mean}(\text{Spread})}{\text{Rolling Std Dev}(\text{Spread})}$$Signal Interpretation: $Z > 2.0$ signals Overbought (Short Spread), $Z < -2.0$ signals Oversold (Long Spread).7.5. Cointegration Testing (Augmented Dickey-Fuller - ADF)(If implemented) The ADF test is run on the spread series to confirm its stationarity (mean-reversion property).P-Value Interpretation: A P-value below 0.05 rejects the null hypothesis, confirming the pair is cointegrated.8. Dashboard Screenshots[SCREENSHOT 2: Dashboard Visualization]Please insert a screenshot here showing the final React dashboard visualization. This should include the price chart, the Z-score plot, and ideally the final analytical table to showcase the working end-to-end flow.9.
